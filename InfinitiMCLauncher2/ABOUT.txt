Version 2.0 of the InfinitiMCLauncher will be a complete overhaul to the application, and shall be implemented properly to hopefully achieve the following:
	- Better stability. (Organised background workers)
	- Fix problems with permissions on some users systems
	- Support launching Minecraft 1.7+ rather than just 1.6- (Accesstoken retrieval)
	- New and improved UI design.
	- Proper integrated launcher logging into UI.
	- Proper minecraft install validation.
	- Downloading of official minecraft assets from mojang rather than a custom zip.
